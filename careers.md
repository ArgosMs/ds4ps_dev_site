## Data Science Careers in Public Affairs

You will find here some resources for students and faculty that are applying data science tools to public and nonprofit sector contexts. These include pedagogical resources for students doing graduate-level work in MPA and MPP programs, PhD seminars that share data programming resources, and data science methods within the field of public policy using R.

## The Open Source Ecosystem

Open source tools and data programming languages have evolved rapidly and are quickly becoming industry standard for data scientists. 

The R community has taken this to another scale. There are currently 13,000 free and open-source packages available in R. It is better to think about R as an operating system, and the contributed packages as the programs you use for specific tasks.

In addition to packages created for R, there are also powerful tools that make it easier to share data, collaborate on work, and share your results in creative ways. One of the reasons R has become an industry favorite is that it is highly integrated into this ecosystem. Many of these tools are built-right into R Studio, making it easier to manage large projects or collaborate.

<br>

Public Affairs programs are adopting these technologies because they are free and powerful. A single data programming language like R can perform statistical analysis, dynamic reporting, GIS, analysis for qualitative research, and other functions, meaning it can be substituted for several expensive software licenses, making it a good choice for public sector and nonprofit organizations that don't have large technology budgets.

<br>


It also lends itself to open innovation since analytical solutions to public sector problems can be easily shared and adopted across localities to encourage collaboration and support an ecosystem of performance.

<br>


There is a non-trivial learning curve to master some of the tools, but the good news is that there are now plenty of good resources.
