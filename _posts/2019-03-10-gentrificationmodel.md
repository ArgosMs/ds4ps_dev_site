Ken Streif at [Urban Spatial](http://urbanspatialanalysis.com/) has introduced an [interesting predictive model](http://urbanspatialanalysis.com/portfolio/predicting-gentrification-using-longitudinal-census-data/) that cities can adopt to anticipate development intensity and gentrification patterns.

In their own words:

> Our major methodological contribution is the adoption of endogenous gentrification theory in the development of spatial features that are effective for predicting prices in a machine learning context without overfitting.

> Our training models use 1990 and 2000 data to predict for 2010 yielding an **average prediction error of just 14% across all tracts**. When this error is considered on a city-by-city basis, the median error is around 8%. It is important to note that our endogenous feature approach does not overfit the model. 

> We think these results are admirable given the limitations of our time series; that our unit of analysis, census tracts, rarely if ever conform to true real estate submarkets and that neighborhood decline is still the predominate dynamics in these Legacy Cities. 

> These algorithms and technological innovations such as the information system described above, can play a pivotal role in how community stakeholders allocate their limited resources across space.
