In partnership with [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/2019/winners-of-the-world-data-visualization-prize/), the [World Government Summit Data Viz Prize](https://wdvp.worldgovernmentsummit.org/) winners were announced.  

Conducted in partnership with the [World Government Summit](https://www.worldgovernmentsummit.org/), the prize focuses on how governments are improving citizens’ lives. 

Entrants were asked to use the power of data-visualization to illuminate data on the innovations and decisions – seen and unseen – that drive progress.
